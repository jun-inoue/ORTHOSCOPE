## Installation　　　
If users install orthoscope on your own web server, download Source code from [Releases](https://github.com/jun-inoue/orthoscope/releases) and set up the server as follows:
- save downloaded scripts_serverConstruction/html and cgi-bin directories in /var/www/.
- install R and a package, [ape](https://github.com/emmanuelparadis/ape?tab=readme-ov-file).
- save dowlonaded dependencies in the /cgi-bin/orthoscopeScripts directory (see cgi-bin/orthoscopeScripts/README.txt).   

Those scripts were confirmed to run on the Linux operating system with an Apache HTTP Server Server.
